Automatic Air Conditioning Control

Device controls simple ON/OFF air conditioning in car. 3 modes: ON, OFF, AUTOMATIC. On automatic mode set temperature will be maintained, also AC will turn on while humidity is high. While on "OFF" mode you cas set humidity at which AC should turn ON. Mode, set temperature, and set humidity is stored on EEPROM (values will remain after reset or power off). CLicking red button changes mode, clicking black button changes humidity/termperature value down, clicking yellow button changes humidity/termperature value up, clicking black & yellow at the same time turns LCD light on/off. 

Used elements:
- Arduino UNO R3 CH340 AVR ATmega 328
- LCD display 1602 + i2C converter (display: mode, measured temperature, set temperature)
- 3x tack switch (mode, up, down)
- 2x temperature/humidity sensor + 4k7 resistor
- 1 channel relay 5V 10A

todo:
- adding sensors to program - done
- prevent display flashing  - done
- check proper turn on/off conditions for automatic mode - done 
- autmoatic/manual display light control - manual done
